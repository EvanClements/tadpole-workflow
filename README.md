Tadpole Workflow
===============

by EvanClements

Tadpole is a project to provide an easy to use GUI for tzlion's frogtool. However it has since added additional features. 

It allows you to rebuild the preset game lists on the SF2000 / Datafrog emulator handheld, so you can add (or remove) ROMs
in the proper system categories instead of only being able to add them in the user folder.

This is just an attempt to apply GitHub actions and minor code changes to allow automated creation of cross-platform executables. 

Hopefully these changes will eventually be merged into the main repo.
